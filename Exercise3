#Question 2
dt = read.table('E3COMPR.txt', sep = '\t', header = TRUE)
attach(dt)
head(dt); tail(dt)
any(is.na(dt))  #to check NA in dataset

#2a: Calculate the sample means and standard deviations of the 
#compressive strengths (separate for 2 samples)
colMeans(dt, na.rm = TRUE) #means
colMeans(na.omit(dt))  #another way to calculate means 

(var = c(var(CONCR1, na.rm = TRUE), var(CONCR2))) #variances
sqrt(var)  #standard deviation

#plot histograms of data sets
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(CONCR1)
hist(CONCR2)

#2-sample t-test
t.test(CONCR1, CONCR2, alternative = 'two.sided', conf.level = 0.95)
# since the p-value is 10^(-7) < alpha = .05, we reject the null hypothesis.

#2c: general assumptions of 2 sample t-test are:
# - normal distribution
# - iid 
# - (x_i,y_i) should be independent
# - n > 25 and m > 25, then the t-test reliable. 


#Question 3:

attach(salary.dt)
head(salary.dt)
names(salary.dt)  #check names of dataset columns

# calculate sample mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum,
# using summary to find min, max, median v.v for both female and male 
summary(salary.dt)
(var = diag(var(salary.dt)))  # variance
sqrt(var) # sd

#Draw box plots of the data sets.
boxplot(FEMALE, MALE, names = c('Female', 'Male'), main = 'Box plot of Dataset')

# Method 1: 90% bootstrap confidence interval of the mean salary. 
require('boot')  # or library(boot)

# create function for boot() 
mean.fun = function(dat, idx) mean(dat[idx], na.rm = TRUE)
# note that indices is required for technical reasons 
# dat (data) argument is the orginal sample
# and indices is used to choose a sample of the original data 'dat'

# bootstrap for female
boot.fe = boot(FEMALE, mean.fun, R = 1000, sim = "ordinary")
boot.fe
plot(boot.fe)
boot.ci(boot.fe, conf = 0.9)

# bootstrap for male
boot.ma = boot(MALE, mean.fun, R = 1000, sim = "ordinary")

boot.ci(boot.ma, conf = 0.9)

# Paired t-test to test the equality of the salaries of men
# and women. (Use two tailed alternative hypothesis.)
t.test(FEMALE, MALE, alternative = 'two.sided', paired = TRUE)
# p-value is .03 

# two sample t-test to test the equality of the salaries of
# men and women. (Use two tailed alternative hypothesis.)
t.test(FEMALE, MALE, alternative = 'two.sided')
# p-value is .2 

# the data is stratified, so the data pairs (x_i,y_i) are not independent. 
# which violates iid assumption of the two sample t-test. But paired t-test
# does not require iid of data pairs => rely on paired t-test result. 
# Paired t-test is more trustworthy. 
# However, the sample size is quite small n = 8, thus not statistically significant.
