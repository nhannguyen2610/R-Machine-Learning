# 3: In poll 1, the sample size was 1000 and 200 out of the 1000 eligible voters
# reported that they support the party BBB (Benâ€™s Bad Boys). In poll 2,
# that was conducted later, the sample size was 1120 and 200 out of the
# 1120 eligible voters reported that they support BBB. Based on these
# polls, can one conclude that support of BBB has decreased?

# can't one conclude that support of BBB has decreased. According to the prop test of poll 1,
# 95% CI is from 0.1759 to 0.2264 and the proportion of poll 2 at 0.1786 is within the range. 
# therefore, the true population parameter can be varied between that range.
